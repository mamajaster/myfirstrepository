    <blockquote>One of my great passions in life is to bring awareness about children in foster care.
      Growing up, I knew that one day I wanted to foster children. After the loss of a pregnancy,
      my grief propelled me into my life as a foster mamma! Our family decided the perfect healing environment for fostering would be a farm.
      So we bought property and started the John 3:16 Farm! We have since adopted a sibling group of 3, which
      has ended our journey in fostering for the time being, as we have a very full house! But my mission is far from over. I am determined
      to bring awareness to the general public on the ever growing need of foster parents. Read more here on our mission at
      the <a href="john316.html" target="_blank"> John 3:16 Farm!</a> </blockquote>
